## Hi There! 👋

👋 Hi, I'm Victor Yu. I am a Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia with a background in mechanical engineering and product design. Welcome to my GitHub where you'll find my projects as I am exploring my passion for software engineering and computing. I hold a Bachelor of Applied Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Waterloo.

- 🔭 I’m interested in full-stack software development, cloud and backend infrastructure, embedded systems software development, and software-hardware integration. My goal is to leverage software and my engineering background to develop technologies that address challenges in our society and create meaningful impact at scale.
- 🌱 I’m learning and improving my knowledge in software design principles, frontend & backend development, data structures and algorithms, and computer systems and architecture
- 🧑‍💻 I previously worked as a mechancial and product design engineer on embedded IoT devices, electromechanical systems, and high-tech consumer products
- 🤝 Always looking to collaborate on projects, hackathons, and grow together!
- 📫 Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorwlyu/) or through email at victor.wlyu AT gmail.com. I look forward to connecting!
